Small update

Yahoo updated their finance API so I needed to update the program, everthying else is the same.

Hopefully I remember to post screenshots of the results in this update to prove it still works.

Remember you need to predict two days in advance

Example: 
You want to buy/sell a stock on Monday closing about 3:30 PM ish to sell/buy back on Tuesday for profit
You actually need to predict Monday's closing price as well as Tuesday's closing price

The program is not good with exact numbers but it is good with predicting if the stock will go up or down.
